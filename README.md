LinkSharingApp is a simple application for shortening and sharing links conveniently. It provides an easy way to share long URLs in a more user-friendly manner.

## Features 
- _*User-Friendly Interface**_
  - A clean and intuitive interface for a seamless user experience

## How it's working?
  The chat is an application written using JavaScript, Sass, and Gulp. The application's functionality is based on rendering and saving new messages in an array located in the js/data/conversationData.js file. ChatApp checks whether a written message was sent 20 minutes ago. If so, after sending a new message, ChatApp creates a new conversation, starting with rendering the current date and time.
